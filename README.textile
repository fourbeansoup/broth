h1. Four Bean Soup Broth

"Four Bean Soup":http://fourbeansoup.com is a web application development company (mainly "Josh Owens":http://railsfreak.com). We focus on creating smart, usable web sites built on a foundation of clean, extensible, handcrafted code. We eat our own dog food, we use Broth as our core starting point to ensure consistency through-out our applications. We cook all our goodness in here, Once.

Broth is built with certain specific standards and opinions in mind. We were tired of re-writing and copy & pasting the same code over and over from project to project. Then git came along. Git helped us realize there was a better way.

h2. Key Concepts

* Make the app extensible by offering smart hooks for engines and plugins to add functionality
* Keep the code clean. Break repeating code out into partials and re-use as needed
* Write semantic HTML/Haml. Of course clean, organized CSS/Sass goes with that. And with the help of Compass, we get to ensure that we keep our CSS/Sass DRY
* Tests, tests, tests. If you aren't testing. You are wrong.

h2. Opinionated Choices

* "Haml":http://haml-lang.com/, "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/, "Compass":http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass
* "JQuery":http://jquery.com/
* "JQuery Tools":http://flowplayer.org/tools/
* "qTip":http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/
* Resque
* Devise
* NewRelic
* Hoptoad

h2. Gotchas

* We try to use "Markers" in key files, such as routes and application.js. We do this to ensure that continued foundation development doesn't trample continued application development
* Don't annotate the models in the base Broth application. You should only be annotating the models in your real application
